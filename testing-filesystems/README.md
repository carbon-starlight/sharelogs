After my system ran out of memory and decided to sacrifise old logs, something weird happened in the journald's binary format black box and my tool no longer was able to load them properly or most often at all. So I decided to find and upload here relative files from a normally functioning filesystem.

I believe this page will also be useful when I will work on Mac/Windows support.
